==========

- Added appendices.

- Solved a bug that caused an unwated vertical space (a new line) to be
  added between bibliography entries. This problem was only noticeable
  when a bibliography entry had no URL.

- The package "glossaries-extra" is now used in replacement of
  "glossaries", since it provides additional features.

- Improved automatic detection of the TeX engine: pdfTeX or LuaTeX.
  Now, it is not necessary to edit the "main.tex" file to choose the TeX
  compiler.

- Hyphenation is now enabled by default.

- Changed "fancyhdr" heading: chapter is left-aligned at odd pages and
  right-aligned at even pages.

- Regarding the author-year style. Citations can:
  - Use parentheses (default behavior) or square brackets.
  - Link only the year, or include the author name (default behavior).

- Renamed labels of chapters, sections, etc.

- Other small changes.

==========

- UA thesis style file (uathesis.sty):
  - Renamed directory for the images from "fig" to "img".
  - Department name removed from the cover page and the first page.
  - Vertical space before the rule is always present even when the
    department name is not shown.
  - Horizontal rule height set to 1.0pt.

- Choosing pdfTeX or LuaTeX as compiler is now possible. LuaTeX is the
  default due to its capabilities with font types (fontspec package).

- Language selection is now easier (Portuguese, UKenglish, or
  USenglish).

- Commands for Latin expressions were added.

- Other small changes.
